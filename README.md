# Twemojis for phpBB

Replace the default phpBB emoticons with emoji-style "twemojis", for consistent style with how phpBB handles actual emojis. Covers all the default emoticons except for `:mrgreen:` and `:ugeek:`, which have no equivalents.

## Instructions

* Upload the contents of this zip file to your 'phpBB3/images/smilies' directory.
* Go to Administration Control Panel > Posting > Smilies.
* Click "Install smilies package".
* Select twemoji.pak from the dropdown, choose the "Replace matches" option (or "Delete all" if you want to remove `:mrgreen:` and `:ugeek:`), then click "Install smilies package".
